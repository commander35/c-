    <p class="short" style="font-size:18px;"> Creating and growing a business is highly risky unless you have the experience and access to the right people. The key for a successful business is often the ecosystem and access to tools, talent, channels, knowledge and capital within it. University networks can reduce risks across industries by providing a proxy for the trust, standards, knowledge base and web of relationships that exist within close-knit communities. Yet with one or two notable exceptions, university networks are currently leveraged more effectively for careers involving existing products, services, models and organizations, than for building new ones. RebelBase bridges the gap by connecting people to the resources and know-how they need to launch and grow their own solutions successfully. Social, professional and dating platforms enable people to find other people; Rebelbase connects people with projects and the resources they need to succeed. This gives users an effective format for refining and showcasing the venture, and for attaching talent, resources, proofs and other critical components.

Rebelbase fosters an online community that makes ideas real. Users create profiles for themselves and their projects, take advantage of samples and instruction for how to create demos, prototypes, wireframe, use cases, animations and videos; and find co-founders, team members, advisers, service providers and investors. On RebelBase, “projects” can be either organizations or ideas. This include new and growing ventures, social enterprises and community organizations, as well as innovative concepts, products, services, and models at various stages of development.
